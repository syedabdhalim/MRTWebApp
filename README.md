### Assignment question

Develop an online ticketing system for Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) based on ASP.NET MVC using C#. You must develop this in a group of 2 to 3 students.

The fare is based on the fare table given [here](https://www.myrapid.com.my/clients/Myrapid_Prasarana_37CB56E7-2301-4302-9B98-DFC127DD17E9/contentms/img/20161117_mrt_sbk_cash_fare_table_3.jpg). The system must allow passengers to purchase one or more tickets from any selected station to another. The tickets can be one-way or return tickets. For senior citizens, disabled and students, there is a 50% discount of the fare rate for every journey.

To purchase the tickets using the system, the purchaser must provide the purchaser name, identity card or passport number and email address. For every purchase, the purchaser personal information and the details of the tickets and payment made must be emailed to the purchaser. The date of the transaction must be clearly included in the email. 

In addition to functionality, a clean and good design of the user interface is important. Please make sure that you have also included the necessary input validation.

You are required to upload the complete project folder (compressed in zip or rar). In addition, you must submit a report that includes the code and screen capture of selected pages of your system.
